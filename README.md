# Google Drive CMS

## Getting Started

First create desktop app credentials by following the steps in the [Google API node.js quickstart sample](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/nodejs#prerequisites). Then, run:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

## Running your own samples

- "Make a copy" of each of the sample docs in this folder
- Share those copied docs with the Google service account you created during "Getting Started" (e.g. `google-drive-cms@npm-drive-cms.iam.gserviceaccount.com`)
- Modify the `?id=` parameter inside the samples to correspond to the correct id
